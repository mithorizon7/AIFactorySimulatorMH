Minor Imbalance: Potentially Punishing Research Rate

The algorithm research progress is heavily tied to freeCompute. A player who successfully builds a revenue stream by attracting customers will see their research rate plummet, potentially halting their game progression. While this tension is intentional, it may be too severe.

The Problem: The algorithmResearchRate is calculated with 0.5 + (computeEfficiency * architectureMultiplier). The computeEfficiency uses Math.log10(freeCompute + 1). The logarithmic scaling means that as freeCompute drops (due to paying customers), the bonus to research speed disappears very quickly, leaving the player with only the base rate.
Impact: Players might feel punished for succeeding at the economic part of the game. They may get stuck for long periods waiting for research to complete, making the game feel grindy.
Recommendation: Add a factor to the research rate that is not dependent on freeCompute, such as a bonus from the number of researchEngineers hired.
Solution:

Adjust the algorithmResearchRate formula to give more weight to direct investment (hiring engineers), making it a viable alternative to relying solely on freeCompute.

TypeScript
// In the useEffect game loop, inside the handleGameTick function

            // ... (inside the 'else' block for when not training)
            const architectureMultiplier = 1 + (newState.algorithmInputs.architectures * 0.1);
            const computeEfficiency = Math.log10(freeCompute + 1) * 0.5;
            
            // *** ADD a bonus for hired engineers ***
            const engineerBonus = (newState.algorithmInputs.researchEngineers || 0) * 0.25; // Each engineer adds a flat 0.25 to the rate

            // Calculate new research rate:
            newState.training.algorithmResearchRate = Math.max( 
              0.1,
              0.5 + engineerBonus + (computeEfficiency * architectureMultiplier) // Add the engineer bonus here
            );
            
            // ... (rest of the logic)
By implementing these balance changes, you will create a more fair, engaging, and robust gameplay experience that guides the player through the intended strategic challenges without hitting impossible walls.
