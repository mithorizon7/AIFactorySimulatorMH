1. Compute

Compute acts similarly to “electricity” in Factorio—central, crucial, and used in nearly every process.

Inputs to Compute (these would be raw resources and processes):
	•	Money (Funding)
	•	Secured through investor rounds, governmental funding, commercial success, or licensing.
	•	Electricity
	•	Generated from sources like renewable, coal, nuclear—each with different cost/efficiency/environmental trade-offs.
	•	Hardware Availability (GPUs/TPUs)
	•	NVIDIA breakthroughs unlock better hardware tech (e.g., new GPU architectures: Hopper, Blackwell, etc.).
	•	Regulatory Environment
	•	Regulations impact available compute. Stricter regulations can reduce compute availability or increase costs, while favorable regulations lower barriers.

Output from Compute:
	•	Compute Capacity
	•	Higher compute unlocks the ability to train larger, more capable models, or multiple specialized models in parallel.
	•	Cheaper usage cost per compute cycle
	•	Efficiency breakthroughs decrease compute cost over time, enabling more complex training at lower expense.

2. Data

Data is analogous to raw materials (iron, copper, coal, oil) that have diverse qualities and forms. Data feeds into model intelligence directly.

Data breaks down into three primary categories:

A. Quantity of Data

Analogous to mining operations—more and faster extraction provides volume.
	•	Processes:
	•	Web Scraping (automated extraction from internet sources)
	•	Digitization Facilities (analog records → digital data)
	•	Licensing Deals (Reddit, NYT, specialized datasets)
	•	Synthetic Data Factories (data generation from models)
	•	Outputs:
	•	Increased volume and availability of data for training models.
	•	Early-game critical; diminished returns late-game without quality improvements.

B. Quality of Data

Quality improvements act like refining ore into more usable alloys—better inputs yield higher-quality outcomes.
	•	Processes:
	•	Curation Teams (human reviewers or advanced filtering algorithms)
	•	Diversity Collection Initiatives (efforts to collect data from diverse cultural, linguistic, or situational contexts)
	•	Bias Detection & Removal Labs (teams/processes dedicated to improving fairness and accuracy)
	•	Outputs:
	•	More accurate, fairer, robust AI models.
	•	Vital for mid-to-late game to avoid diminishing returns from merely increasing quantity.

C. Format & Structure of Data (Data Design)

Analogous to “advanced circuits,” crafted through targeted combination of basic data resources.
	•	Processes:
	•	Specialized Datasets (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning datasets)
	•	Multimodal Data Fusion Labs (text+images+audio data pipelines)
	•	Algorithmically Enhanced Data Design (new methods unlocked by algorithm breakthroughs—reasoning algorithms, prompt engineering methods)
	•	Outputs:
	•	Improved cognitive capabilities in models (logical reasoning, complex task-solving).
	•	High-value late-game resource with significant leverage on intelligence.

3. Algorithm Lab

Think of Algorithm Labs as “research labs” in Factorio that unlock entirely new technologies, recipes, and efficiency.
	•	Inputs:
	•	Funding (money)
	•	Highly Skilled AI Researchers (trained via education or acquired)
	•	Compute (training experiments, iterative development)
	•	Early-Access to Cutting-edge Data (new datasets, specialized high-quality data)
	•	Outputs:
	•	Breakthroughs in Model Architectures:
	•	Transformers, diffusion models, multimodal architectures.
	•	Efficiency Breakthroughs:
	•	Model distillation, quantization, sparsity—allowing models to perform better with less compute.
	•	New Data Processing Methods:
	•	Reasoning strategies (Chain-of-thought, Tree-of-thought)
	•	Improved synthetic data generation

These unlock fundamentally new capabilities or significantly enhance existing ones.

Conceptual Interrelation & Gameplay Dynamics:

In your game, each resource pipeline will interconnect and feed back into others:
	•	Compute → Intelligence:
	•	More compute means training larger models, unlocking higher AI intelligence capabilities.
	•	Algorithm breakthroughs reduce compute costs, making previously infeasible training feasible.
	•	Data → Intelligence:
	•	Quantity gives generalization power (early game)
	•	Quality improves fairness and accuracy, becoming critical as complexity grows (mid-game)
	•	Format and structure of data directly enhance intelligence by enabling specialized reasoning (late game).
	•	Algorithm Lab ↔ Compute ↔ Data (cyclical relationship):
	•	Algorithmic advances improve compute efficiency (distillation, quantization).
	•	More compute enables faster, more expansive algorithm research.
	•	New algorithmic breakthroughs enable radically new types of data and data processing, improving data quality and format.
