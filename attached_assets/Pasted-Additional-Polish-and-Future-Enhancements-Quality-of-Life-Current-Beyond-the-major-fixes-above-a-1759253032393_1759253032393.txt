Additional Polish and Future Enhancements (Quality-of-Life)
Current: Beyond the major fixes above, a few smaller issues and opportunities for enhancement remain. For instance, some tutorial highlights could be more precise – e.g., in Phase 2 Step 1 the tutorial says “Click on the Compute Factory section” and highlights the entire Compute card

, but the actual interactive element is the “Advanced Compute Options” button. A user might try clicking the highlighted card background (which does nothing) if they don’t notice the button at the bottom. Additionally, the game isn’t explicitly paused during the tutorial (though it doesn’t start running until you hit start), and there’s no way to revisit tutorial info once closed (except restarting the game).
Desired: We aim for a highly polished tutorial experience: clear cues, no ambiguity in what to click, and options for the user to control the tutorial if needed. Once the critical loading/sequence issues are resolved, refining these details will further improve onboarding. For example, highlighting the exact button or UI control the user should press (perhaps by setting targetElement to a more specific identifier) would remove any guesswork. We might also consider adding a brief description on the final screen about where to find help or re-play the tutorial (in case the user wants to reference it later). Another idea is to disable the main simulation start until the tutorial is finished or skipped, ensuring new players don’t ignore the tutorial and get lost – but this depends on how you want to balance freedom vs guidance.
Why: These changes elevate the user experience from functional to truly user-friendly. Every bit of clarity and guidance counts, especially for a complex sim like this. By refining highlight targets and instructions, we make sure players don’t misinterpret the tutorial cues. And by managing game state (pausing updates or locking certain actions during tutorial steps), we prevent the player from doing things out-of-order (for instance, starting the game loop or spending money on the wrong things) that could disrupt the intended flow. Providing a way to review tutorial tips (maybe a “Help” section or resetting the tutorial without wiping the game) could be valuable for retention, though that can be a later enhancement.
Solution: Fine-tune highlight and text: Audit each tutorial step’s targetElement against the UI. If needed, add new data-tutorial-id hooks for specific buttons (e.g., the accordion triggers for “Advanced Options”) and update the tutorial content to point to those instead of broad container divs. For instance, you could give the “Advanced Compute Options” accordion trigger a data-tutorial-id="compute-advanced-btn" and set that as the target for step 1, so the blue spotlight clearly encircles the button the user should click. Update the tutorial text if necessary to explicitly mention the button. Game state control: Since the game doesn’t start until clicking “Start Game,” you already delay resource decay and income during the tutorial. Just ensure that if a user tries to start the game in the middle of the tutorial, they either get a prompt or the tutorial gracefully auto-completes. One approach is to intercept startGame() if tutorial.isActive – for example, auto-skip or complete the tutorial at that moment (so they don’t play with the overlay still on). You might also set isRunning to false whenever a tutorial modal/spotlight is active (to pause any incidental background activity). Accessibility & restart: Finally, consider adding a control to re-open the tutorial or key tips. Perhaps set hasPlayedAIFactory false when resetting the game (so the tutorial runs again), or have an in-game “Help” button that reactivates tutorial mode (by resetting gameState.tutorial to the beginning or a chosen step). These are nice-to-haves that can be done once the main issues are fixed.
