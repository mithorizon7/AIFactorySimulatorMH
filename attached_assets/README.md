# Attached Assets Directory

This directory contains reference materials and documentation for the AI Factory educational game project.

## Active Reference Files

The following files contain **current, relevant information** that guides ongoing development:

### Core Design Documents
- `Comprehensive Conceptual Framework.txt` - Defines the three AI pillars (Compute, Data, Algorithms) and educational framework
- `Main Educational Goals.txt` - Learning outcomes and design principles for the educational simulation
- `The Game Design Document.txt` - Master design document outlining gameplay structure and mechanics

### Current Feature Implementation
- `Pasted-Here-are-the-detailed-instructions-broken-down-into-two-main-features-Feature-1-Interactive-Onbo-1750187865246_1750187865246.txt` - Interactive tutorial system implementation specs
- `Pasted-Feature-The-Spark-AI-Advisor-Objective-Introduce-a-fictional-character-Spark-who-acts-as-the--1750190446188_1750190446189.txt` - Spark AI Advisor character implementation
- `Pasted-An-analysis-of-the-existing-onboarding-process-reveals-a-solid-foundation-that-can-be-transformed-in-1751463652178_1751463652178.txt` - Current tutorial analysis and recommendations
- `Pasted-Of-course-Your-intuition-is-spot-on-Shifting-from-a-passive-card-based-tutorial-to-an-interactive-1751464648176_1751464648177.txt` - Advanced interactive tutorial system with spotlight effects

## Archive Folder

The `archive/` subdirectory contains **historical materials** from previous development iterations. These files include:

- Outdated game balance discussions and problems that have been resolved
- Early architecture designs that have been superseded
- Old UI screenshots from previous versions
- Duplicate implementation files with conflicting approaches
- Legacy game mechanics that are no longer relevant

**For Future Developers:** You can safely ignore everything in the `archive/` folder unless you need to understand the historical evolution of design decisions or are troubleshooting why certain approaches were abandoned. The active reference files above contain all current, actionable information.

## File Naming Convention

Files with long, cryptic names starting with "Pasted-" are conversation exports from development sessions. Despite the unusual naming, they contain valuable implementation details and should be referenced when working on related features.
