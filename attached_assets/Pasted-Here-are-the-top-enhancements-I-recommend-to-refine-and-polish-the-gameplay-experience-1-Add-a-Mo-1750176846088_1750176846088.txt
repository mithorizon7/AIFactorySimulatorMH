Here are the top enhancements I recommend to refine and polish the gameplay experience.

1. Add a Monetary Cost to Training Runs

This is the single most impactful change you can make to improve strategic depth. Real-world AI model training is incredibly expensive, not just in terms of computation but also in direct R&D costs. Adding a monetary cost to your training runs introduces a fantastic strategic tension.

Why It Matters: Currently, a player only needs to save up enough compute. By adding a money cost, you force a difficult choice: "Do I spend my cash on upgrading my infrastructure to generate compute faster, or do I save it to afford the next big training run?" This makes managing the economy a crucial part of the late-game strategy.
How to Implement It:
First, add a moneyCost to each training run's definition in your game state.
Then, check for and deduct this cost in the startEraTrainingRun function.

TypeScript
// Add a "moneyCost" to each training run. The cost should scale significantly.
// Example for the GNT-3 run:
      [Era.GNT3]: {
        targetEra: Era.GNT3,
        status: TrainingStatus.LOCKED,
        daysRequired: 30,
        daysRemaining: 30,
        computeRequired: 1000,
        moneyCost: 50000, // Add this line
        computePerCustomer: 5,
        isTrainingReserveActive: false,
        intelligenceGain: 100,
        prerequisites: { /* ... */ },
        // ...
      },
// Do the same for GNT-4, GNT-5, etc., with increasing costs (e.g., 250000, 1000000).

TypeScript
// In startEraTrainingRun function

    // ... after checking for compute capacity
    
    // *** ADD THIS BLOCK ***
    // Check for money cost
    if (!trainingRun || gameState.money < trainingRun.moneyCost) {
      toast({
        title: "Insufficient Funds for Training",
        description: `You need ${formatCurrency(trainingRun?.moneyCost || 0)} to start this training run.`,
        variant: "destructive",
      });
      return;
    }
    
    // Start the training run
    setGameState(prevState => {
      const newState = { ...prevState };

      // *** ADD THIS LINE ***
      // Deduct the monetary cost
      newState.money -= trainingRun.moneyCost;
      
      // Reserve the compute for training
      newState.computeCapacity.available -= trainingRun.computeRequired;
      // ... rest of the function
