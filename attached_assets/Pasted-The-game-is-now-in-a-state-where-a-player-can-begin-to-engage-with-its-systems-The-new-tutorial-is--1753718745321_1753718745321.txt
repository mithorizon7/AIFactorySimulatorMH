The game is now in a state where a player can begin to engage with its systems. The new tutorial is essential for onboarding, and the advisor messages provide much-needed context. The core gameplay loop of investing money to meet prerequisites for massive "Training Run" events is compelling.

However, the experience would be one of solving an intriguing puzzle for the first 10-15 minutes, followed by hitting a sudden, inexplicable wall. The player will understand the goal but will find it mathematically impossible to achieve, leading to a frustrating and ultimately unfulfilling end to their session.

Biggest Strengths in the Current Code

A Functional and Well-Designed Core Loop: The startEraTrainingRun function is now the clear centerpiece of the game, and it works. It correctly checks for prerequisites, deducts a moneyCost, reserves compute, and puts the game into a "training" state. This creates a clear, cyclical goal for the player: build up your factory to launch the next big training mission. This is a fun and engaging loop.

Vastly Improved Onboarding and Feedback: The introduction of the tutorial state object and the advisorMessage system in useGameEngine.ts is a game-changer for UX. A new player is no longer dropped into a complex system without guidance. The TutorialGuide component (which is not provided but whose logic is in the hook) will walk them through the initial steps, and the Advisor/Spark character will provide narrative context and warnings. This makes the game feel alive and responsive.

A Polished and Professional UI: This remains a top-tier strength. The components used are clean, modern, and well-implemented. The ComputePanel is a standout piece of UI, effectively visualizing a complex set of prerequisites in a way that is easy to understand at a glance. The visuals promise a high-quality experience.

What Needs to Change: The Critical Flaws Preventing Playability

Despite the progress, the following issues will stop a player's journey cold and must be the highest priority for the development team.

1. The "Compute Wall" Still Exists - The Game is Unwinnable

This is the most critical issue. While the intent to fix the compute scaling is there, the implemented formula in useGameEngine.ts is still insufficient and makes the game unwinnable.

Code Analysis: Inside the handleGameTick function, the maxCapacity is now calculated with Math.pow(1.8, newState.levels.compute). While this is an exponential formula, it scales too slowly against the hard-coded 10x requirement for computeRequired in gameState.ts (1,000 -> 10,000 -> 100,000). A player would need to reach an incredibly high compute level to meet the GNT-4 requirement of 10,000, and the GNT-5 requirement of 100,000 is completely out of reach within a 30-minute playtime.

Player Frustration: This is the most frustrating kind of bug. The player will understand the goal perfectly. They will invest their money correctly. But they will watch their capacity number grow far too slowly to ever hit the target. They will feel like they are doing something wrong when, in fact, the game's math is simply broken.

Recommendation: Aggressively increase the scaling in the maxCapacity formula. The base of the exponent needs to be much larger, or you need to add significant linear bonuses from hardware and other investments. The goal should be that achieving the level prerequisites for a training run should naturally bring your maxCapacity into the range of the computeRequired.

2. The Breakthrough System is Still Broken

This is another critical progression blocker that remains unfixed from the previous analysis.

Code Analysis: The checkBreakthroughs function, which is the only way to unlock breakthroughs and advance the currentGoal, is still never called by the functions that the player actually uses (allocateMoneyTo...). The only calls are within the now-dead legacy code.

Player Frustration: The "Breakthroughs" tab in the UI will remain static for the entire game. The BreakthroughSection will show the same initial goal forever. The player will have no idea how to unlock these, and it will feel like a core part of the game is missing because it is.

Recommendation: This is a simple but essential one-line fix. Add a call to newState.breakthroughs = checkBreakthroughs(newState); to the end of every allocateMoneyTo... function in useGameEngine.ts.
