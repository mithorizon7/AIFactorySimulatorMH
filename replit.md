## Overview

This project is an educational AI Factory Simulator built with React and Express.js. It's designed to teach users about generative AI development factors through an interactive game where players manage the three core pillars of AI advancement: Compute, Data, and Algorithms. The goal is to progress through AI eras (GNT-2 through GNT-7) by completing training runs and achieving artificial general intelligence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **UI Components**: Radix UI component library for accessible, unstyled primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom game engine logic
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: TSX for running TypeScript server directly
- **Production**: ESBuild for server bundling, Vite for frontend
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

## Key Components

### Game Engine (`useGameEngine.ts`)
The core game logic handles:
- Resource production and consumption (Compute, Data, Algorithms)
- Training run mechanics with era progression
- Revenue generation from B2B/B2C customers
- Compute capacity management (total capacity vs. usage)
- Algorithm research progress tracking

### Factory System
Three main resource factories:
1. **Compute Factory**: Manages computational resources through infrastructure investments
2. **Data Factory**: Handles data quality and quantity improvements
3. **Algorithm Lab**: Research and development of AI algorithms

### Training Run System
- Discrete events that advance AI eras
- Requires meeting specific thresholds for compute, data, and algorithm levels
- 10x scaling requirement for compute between generations
- 30-day in-game duration with compute reservation

## Data Flow

1. **Resource Investment**: Players spend money to upgrade infrastructure inputs
2. **Capacity Building**: Investments increase maximum compute capacity and production rates
3. **Customer Usage**: B2B/B2C customers consume compute resources and generate revenue
4. **Training Runs**: Players initiate era advancement by reserving compute for training
5. **Research Progress**: Free compute automatically contributes to algorithm research
6. **Era Advancement**: Successful training runs unlock new capabilities and content

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for production data persistence
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries and migrations
- **Connection**: Via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### UI Framework
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive component library for accessible interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom theming
- **React Query**: Server state management and caching

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR and plugin ecosystem
- **ESBuild**: Server bundling for production deployments

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Frontend: Vite dev server with HMR
- Backend: TSX for direct TypeScript execution
- Database: Drizzle Kit for schema pushing and migrations

### Production Environment
- Frontend: Static build served from `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild-bundled Node.js application
- Database: Neon Database with connection pooling

### Build Process
1. `npm run build` - Builds both frontend (Vite) and backend (ESBuild)
2. `npm run start` - Runs production server
3. `npm run db:push` - Applies database schema changes

## Changelog

- September 30, 2025. **ALWAYS-ACCESSIBLE LEADERBOARD WITH GAME PAUSE COMPLETE**: Implemented motivational leaderboard system accessible anytime with automatic game pause and reset confirmation:
  1. **LeaderboardModal Component**: Created standalone modal displaying top 20 AGI achievers with rank medals (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰), player stats (intelligence, time, money, users), strategy badges (B2B/B2C/Speed Run), and empty state messaging
  2. **GameHeader Integration**: Added Trophy button in top-right corner for instant leaderboard access, yellow styling to stand out, responsive labels (hidden on mobile for space)
  3. **Game Pause System**: Integrated with GamePauseContext to automatically pause game time when leaderboard opens, resume on close - prevents time loss during competitive viewing
  4. **Reset Confirmation**: Implemented AlertDialog with detailed progress summary (intelligence level, time elapsed, money, resources) requiring explicit confirmation before reset - prevents accidental data loss
  5. **Educational Design**: Leaderboard serves as motivation by showing other players' achievements and strategies, tip section encourages AGI completion for Hall of Fame entry
  6. **Complete Testing**: Verified leaderboard access, pause/resume functionality, reset confirmation flow, and state persistence - 100% test pass rate with all features working correctly
- September 30, 2025. **MOBILE-RESPONSIVE TAB NAVIGATION COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive mobile-first responsive design for main game tab navigation:
  1. **Responsive Grid Layout**: Changed from fixed 6-column layout to adaptive `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-6` (2 columns mobile â†’ 3 columns tablet â†’ 6 columns desktop)
  2. **Always-Visible Labels**: Removed `hidden sm:inline` pattern - all tab labels (Dashboard, Training, Resources, Economy, Breakthroughs, Progression) now always visible for improved mobile UX
  3. **Proper Touch Targets**: Added `min-h-[44px]` to meet Apple's minimum touch target recommendation, ensuring tabs are easily tappable on mobile devices
  4. **Z-Index Stacking Fix**: Added `relative z-20` to wrapper and `relative z-10` to TabsList to prevent tab content from overlapping and blocking tab triggers on mobile
  5. **Enhanced Spacing**: Increased bottom margin from `mb-4` to `mb-6` for better visual separation between tabs and content
  6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Two Playwright test suites passed with 100% success rate across mobile (375x667), tablet (768x1024), and desktop (1440x900) viewports - verified responsive layouts, label visibility, touch targets, and direct click functionality
